# Shmuppy
 
Welcome to my SHMUP!
For my shmup I wanted to experiment with using different weapons, because a lot of times shmups only have the one cannon or laser to use.
I brainstormed a few different types of weapons and settled on a basic gun, a shield, a laser, and a missile launcher.
After seeing that the laser was way too OP, I decided to add energy levels to the better weapons that would make them run out, so you need to be scarce with your weapon usage.
One of my main design goals was to have the player constantly switching between weapons and running out of energy, I wanted it to be quite chaotic and fast.

After playtesting more I found out that the enemies were much too boring. I spend most of the second half of the project adjusting how they acted and came up with a system for moving between points over time. I also adjusted a lot of the enemy art so that it was easier to see and gave good feedback on when the player was shooting them.
I could talk on and on about my game but its more fun if you play it! Go clone this repo and kill some aliens yourself!
