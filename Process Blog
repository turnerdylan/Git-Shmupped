Version 1.0
I finished my first prototype for the shmup! On the next version I plan to implement the ideas that I came up with on my own.
I got most of my ideas through discussion and brainstorming with other students in the class. I want to find a really cool and
simple mechanic and make it the main function of the game. Once I start implementing it I imagine I will discover a lot about my ideas and see how viable they actually are.

Version 1.1 (On its way!)
